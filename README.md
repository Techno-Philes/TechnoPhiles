# Getting-Started

Hello **Technophiles**, so finally some of us reached till here as a **GitHub Organization** member. Here what we do is explained briefly soon!!


# What we will do here?
Have you ever been in a situation where you had some problem in understanding a part of code? Most of us must have copied a part of code from some source to achieve some problem statement.
When building new projects, there is always some content or a logic that can be used in some other project. Are you wondering why we are telling these things? This is because we want our community
to contribute such content. But where do we contribute our projects, contents and much more?. A platform called the **Open Source** is where we contribute our works, projects to the open 
community. Basically the open source is something that can be modified by the people and it's view is public.

The Open source consists of a **Source** **code** that be inspected, updated and modified.
What do we mean by the source code? It's a code that can be changed by programmers in an attempt to see how a piece of the code or application works when it is manipulated.
Some points to note regarding the open source:

- The owner of the source code makes the content available for other users to use, modify, copy or share it.
- Those trying to utilise the source code must follow certain **terms of licence**.
- The liscence specifices how a person can use the source code. These liscence enable a user to view, copy or share the open source software.
- Licenses basically helps improve the collaboration and sharing which allow people to modify the content and utilise the content to place in their own projects.

# But why **Open Source** ?

 
- Open source is a great learning and developing platfrom for students. Student can learn, enhance and contribute their works. Projects shared in the open source can be corrected by other if there exits any mistakes.
- People will come to know about your works and will further help in your internships or recruitments.
- As you tend to contribute to the open source, you tend to have followers and become a party of a Community.
- As part of the community, you learn more about other people, their project, their interests and much more.

So Guys we would like our community members to extend their contribution towards the open source community, so that we as a team can develop and learn more from others as a community.
Thank you!!.
